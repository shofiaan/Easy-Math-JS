                <h2>“Let's be Smart in Mathematics”</h2>

                <p>Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math is all around us, in everything we do. It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices, architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering, and even sports.</p>

                        </a>
                        <p> The brain regions involved in higher math skills in high-performing children were associated with various cognitive tasks involving visual attention and decision-making.  While correlation may not imply causation, this study indicates that the same brain regions that help you do math are recruited in decision-making and attentional processes.

                        </a>
                        <p>Knowing math, and particularly, fractions, can help you better tell time.  While analog clocks may eventually become obsolete, don’t let your ability to tell time become outdated!  Use your knowledge of fractions to help you tell time on analog clocks that have an hour, minute, and (sometimes) second hand.</p>

                        </a>
                        <p>Math can be helpful for balancing your budget because you will have a good understanding of how to make sure that your costs are less than the money you have.  People who know math are therefore less likely to go into debt because they did not know how much money they had versus how much money they spent</p>
